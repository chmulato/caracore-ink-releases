Professional illustration or photograph-style image: a tattoo artist in their studio environment, focused and at ease. The scene suggests organization and control of the business — for example a clean desk or work surface with a laptop or monitor showing a simple calendar or dashboard-like layout (no readable text or words anywhere in the image), appointment book or clipboard, and subtle hints of tattoo equipment (machine, ink caps, stencil). Warm, professional lighting. The person is clearly a tattooer (visible tattoo work, studio setting, possibly client chair or flash on the wall). Mood: competent, organized, running their studio. No text, no letters, no logos, no words in the image — purely visual. Style: modern, clean, suitable for a software product aimed at tattoo studios; avoid cliché stock-photo look.
